This project aims to introduce the concepts of Shell I/O Redirection. We get to find out the use of commands like head, tail, find, wc, sort, uniq, grep.

We would also learn how to redirect standard output to a file, how to get standard input from a file instead of the keyboard, how to send the output from one program to the input of another program, how to combine commands and filters with redirections.

We would also learn about special characters and their functions.
