This projects aims to  introduce Shell, Init files, Variables and Expansions.

Under Shell Initialization Files, we will look at /etc/profile file and /etc/profile.d directory, and also ~/.bashrc file.

Under variables, we would see the difference between a local and global variable. We would look at reserved variable, how to create, update, delete shell variables, the roles of reserved variables, special parameters.

Under expansions, we would look at their uses, difference between single and double quotes and the uses.

We would also learn how to perform arithmetic operations with the shell.
