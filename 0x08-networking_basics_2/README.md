## Networking basics #1

In computer networking, localhost is a hostname that refers to the current device used to access it. It is used to access the network services that are running on the host via the loopback network interface. Using the loopback interface bypasses any local network interface hardware.

### What's the Linux Hosts File?
The hosts file is a plain text file that all operating systems use to translate hostnames (also known as web addresses or URLs) into IP addresses. When you type in a hostname, such as wikipedia.org, your system will look into the hosts file to get the IP address needed to connect to the appropriate server.
