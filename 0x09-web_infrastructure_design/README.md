## Web infrastructure design

### DNS
DNS is, in simple words, the technology that translates human-adapted, text-based domain names to machine-adapted, numerical-based IP.
### Monitoring
Just as the heart monitor in a hospital that is making sure that a patients heart is beating and at the right beat, software monitoring will watch computer metrics, record them, and emit an alert if something is unusual or that could make the computer not work properly happens.
### Web Server
A web server is a software that delivers web pages. A server is an actual computer.

But you might hear people referring to a web server using the word server. (Check out the server concept page to learn more about this.)

As mentioned above, a server is a physical machine, an actual computer, but in the Cloud era that could also be a virtual computer, generally called a VM (Virtual Machine) or container.
### Network Basics
Networking is a big part of what made computers so powerful and why the Internet exists. It allows machines to communicate with each other.
### Load Balancer
When you have an enterprise application or website that gets lot of hits, your server might be under heavy load. In that case, you may want to consider distributing the load across multiple servers.

Load balancer will distribute the work-load of your system to multiple individual systems, or group of systems to to reduce the amount of load on an individual system, which in turn increases the reliability, efficiency and availability of your enterprise application or website.
### Server
Servers are located in datacenters which are buildings that host hundreds, or even thousands of computers (servers). You can think of a server as a computer without a keyboard, mouse, or screen, that is accessible only by a network. A server can be physical or virtual. A server runs an OS (operating system).
