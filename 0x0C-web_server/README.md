### Child Process
A child process is a process created by another process. The creator process is properly called the parent process. The benefit of a child process is that it can start or stop at will without affecting the parent process. The child process is, however, is typically dependent on the parent process. If the parent process dies, the child process becomes an orphan process.

In normal server operations, the kernel may initiate child processes, and other programs, such as Apache, may have them as well. Apache creates child processes (or children, if you prefer) whenever the number of requests (web page accesses from users) exceeds the maximum allowed number of requests. When the maximum number of child process requests is exceeded, another child process spawns.
