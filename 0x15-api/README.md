## API

An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. Basically, an API specifies how software components should interact. Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer then puts the blocks together.
There are many different types of APIs for operating systems, applications or websites. Windows, for example, has many API sets that are used by system hardware and applications  when you copy and paste text from one application to another, it is the API that allows that to work.
Most operating environments, such as MS-Windows, provide APIs, allowing programmers to write applications consistent with the operating environment. Today, APIs are also specified by websites. For example, Amazon or eBay APIs allow developers to use the existing retail infrastructure to create specialized web stores. Third-party software developers also use Web APIs to create software solutions for end-users.
### REST API

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) help this type of communication between systems by providing an interface for them to talk to each other. REST is simply a widely adopted style of API that we use to communicate with internal and external parties in a consistent and predictable way. It can be compared with how we used to send a letter with a postage stamp, address, and envelope in a certain way to ensure it gets delivered and read.

REST is commonly used by people on the web systems to interact with each other. For example, retrieving and updating account information in a social media application.

### Microservices
Microservice architecture is a distinctive method of developing software systems that tries to focus on building single-function modules with well-defined interfaces and operations.

The trend has grown in recent years as enterprises look to become more Agile and move towards a DevOps and continuous testing.

Microservices have many benefits for Agile and DevOps teams - as Martin Fowler points out, Netflix, eBay, Amazon, Twitter, PayPal, and other tech stars have all evolved from monolithic to microservices architecture.
